###Iteration 1###
1. create the night_writer, night_writer_spec and message files
2. write a 256 character message in message.txt
3. write a program that will read the text in message and create a new file with the same message
4. include 'Created 'braille.txt' containing 256 characters' in the command line
5. update again so the command line can take the argument of the second file and will create a new file based on that
6. make the 'Created 'braille.txt' containing 256 characters' change character count based on the character count of the starting file

###Step 3 broken down###
- access the file that is given in the command line
- read all the information in that file
- create a new file
- copy and paste all that information to the new file
